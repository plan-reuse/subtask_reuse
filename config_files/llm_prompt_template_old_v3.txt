You are given a task for a robot to perform in a kitchen environment.

Task: {task_instruction}

Your job is to break down this task into a sequence of subtasks that the robot can perform. Each subtask
should be described in natural language and should include a corresponding PDDL goal expression using valid
PDDL syntax.

You are also provided with the following domain information to help you generate valid subtasks.

-------------------------------
Provided Domain Information:
-------------------------------

Available Predicates:
{predicates_content}

Available Actions:
{actions_content}

Objects by Type:
{objects_content}

Initial State:
{init_state_content}



Your output should meet the following requirements:

1. Generate a sequence of subtasks that together accomplish the overall task: {task_instruction}

2. Each subtask should be centered around a single object or tightly related object group (e.g., chicken,
potato, or pot). And each subtask must involve a meaningful group of actions, not a single atomic step. Avoid
splitting simple operations (like "move to fridge" or "open door") into separate subtasks. Instead,
group them into a single subtask that completes a full object interaction, such as retrieving an
item and placing it where it will be used.

3. For each subtask, provide:
   - A concise natural language instruction in one sentence describing what the robot must do.
   - A valid PDDL goal expression that represents the desired world state after completing that subtask.

4. All PDDL goal expressions must follow correct Lisp-style syntax.
   - For multiple goals, use compound PDDL syntax such as: (and (predicate1 ...) (predicate2 ...))
   - Do NOT use natural language terms like AND, OR, or NOT in the PDDL goals.


-------------------------------
Output Format (strictly follow this):
-------------------------------

Subtask 1: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 1: [Valid PDDL goal]

Subtask 2: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 2: [Valid PDDL goal]

...

Subtask N: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal N: [Valid PDDL goal]

-------------------------------
Examples:
-------------------------------

Example Subtask: Retrieve the pot from the cabinet and place it on countertop 2.
PDDL Goal: (at pot countertop_2)

Example Subtask: Retrieve the potato from the fridge and place it into the pot.
PDDL Goal: (in_cookware potato pot)

Example Subtask: Place the pot on the stovetop and turn on the stove to cook the food
PDDL Goal: (and (on_stovetop pot stove) (turned_on stove))

Example Subtask: Take the pot from the stovetop to countertop and Turn off the stove
PDDL Goal: (and (at pot countertop) (turned_off stove))

-------------------------------
Important Notes:
-------------------------------
- Ensure the subtasks follow a logical and feasible sequence to complete the given task: {task_instruction}
- Be precise and consistent in naming objects and locations.
- Always double-check that compound PDDL goals are wrapped properly in `(and ...)`.
