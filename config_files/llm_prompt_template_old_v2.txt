You are given a task for a robot to perform in a kitchen environment:

Task: {task_instruction}

Your job is to break down this task into a sequence of subtasks that the robot can perform. Each subtask
should be described in natural language and should include a corresponding PDDL goal expression using valid
PDDL syntax.

You are also provided with the following domain information to help you generate valid subtasks:

Available Predicates:
{predicates_content}

Available Actions:
{actions_content}

Objects by Type:
{objects_content}

Initial State:
{init_state_content}


Your output should meet the following requirements:

1. Generate a sequence of subtasks that together accomplish the overall task: {task_instruction}

2. For each subtask, provide:
   - A concise natural language instruction in one sentence describing what the robot must do.
   - A valid PDDL goal expression that represents the desired world state after completing that subtask.

3. All PDDL goal expressions must follow correct Lisp-style syntax.
   - For multiple goals, use compound PDDL syntax such as: (and (predicate1 ...) (predicate2 ...))
   - Do NOT use natural language terms like AND, OR, or NOT in the PDDL goals.


-------------------------------
Output Format (strictly follow this):
-------------------------------
Subtask 1: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 1: [Valid PDDL goal]

Subtask 2: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 2: [Valid PDDL goal]

...

Subtask N: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal N: [Valid PDDL goal]

-------------------------------
Examples:
-------------------------------

Subtask 1: Move the robot to the fridge.
PDDL Goal 1: (at_robot pr2 fridge)

Subtask 2: Pick up the tomato from the fridge.
PDDL Goal 2: (holding pr2 tomato)

Subtask 3: Place the tomato and potato on the countertop 2.
PDDL Goal 3: (and (at tomato countertop_2) (at potato countertop_2))

-------------------------------
Important Notes:
-------------------------------
- Ensure the subtasks follow a logical and feasible sequence to complete the task: {task_instruction}
- Be precise and consistent in naming objects and locations.
- Always double-check that compound PDDL goals are wrapped properly in `(and ...)`.
