Task: {task_instruction}

I will provide you with information about a kitchen domain, including available predicates, 
actions, objects, and their initial states. Your job is to break down the main task 
into natural language subtasks that need to be completed in sequence, 
and provide the corresponding PDDL goal for each subtask.

Available Predicates:
{predicates_content}

Available Actions:
{actions_content}

Objects by Type:
{objects_content}

Initial State:
{init_state_content}

Based on the task description, available actions, object list, and initial states, 
generate a list of subtasks in natural language that would need to be completed 
to achieve the goal.

Requirements:
1. Each subtask should be a clear, concise instruction 
in natural language in a single sentence

2. Explicitly include the objects involved in each subtask

3. Make sure the subtasks follow a logical sequence to achieve the goal

4. Only include actions that are possible given the predicates and actions available

5. For each natural language subtask, provide the corresponding 
PDDL goal that represents the desired state after completing that subtask

Format the response as follows:
Subtask 1: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 1: [PDDL goal expression]

Subtask 2: [Natural language subtask]
PDDL Goal 2: [PDDL goal expression]

...and so on.
